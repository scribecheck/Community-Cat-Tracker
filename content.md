================ FAQ ================
* Who runs the website?
My name is Colin. I'm an American living in Matsudo City, and I have three pet cats whom I adopted or rescued. 
Recently, I began studying web development. I made this website to practice my skills, and to help everyone in my neighborhood keep track of the community cats more easily. 

* Who can use the website?
Anyone can visit the website. However, please only click the "I saw you today!" buttons if you have actually seen the cat in Sendabori in Matsudo City.

* What is a "community cat"?
A "community cat" is a cat that lives outside and is taken care of by the community. You can learn more about community cats on Matsudo City's website. 

* Does the website save my personal information?
No, the website doesn't save anyone's personal information.
The "I saw you today!" button is only programmed to count how many times it is clicked per week, and refresh that number every Sunday night.

* How can I add a cat profile to the website?
Thanks for helping out!
You can use this form to submit a new cat profile or suggest changes to an existing one. 

* I found a sick/injured cat outside, what should I do?
Visit the Resources section for links to local and national volunteer organizations, online support gropus for cat rescue, and NPOs in Japan.
Because this website is managed by just one person, I'm not able to respond to direct inquiries about cat rescue, even for cats in the neighborhood.
